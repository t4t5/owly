//! The driver (the `driver` feature): a [`Node`] run on any radio that can
//! inject and capture 802.11 frames, on std and tokio.
//!
//! A backend brings such a radio up, then hands the driver its two ends:
//! the [`Air`], where the node's frames go out and the peers' come in, and
//! the [`Netif`], the host's network interface for the link (a TAP device
//! on Linux), where IPv6 packets come and go. A monitor interface on the
//! computer and a radio elsewhere, an ESP32 over USB say, differ only in
//! their `Air`.
//!
//! [`spawn`] runs the node on a thread of its own with a single-threaded
//! tokio runtime, so nothing else in the process delays its timers. It logs
//! how late they fire.
